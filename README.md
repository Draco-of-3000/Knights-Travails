# Knights-Travails
This is a Ruby project that implements a program to find the shortest path a knight can take to move from one position to another on an 8x8 chessboard. The program uses an unweighted graph data srtucture and a breadth-first search algorithm to explore all possible moves and find the optimal path.

## Features

- Create an 8x8 chessboard and visualize the knight's movements.
- Find the shortest path for the knight to move between any two positions on the board.
- Display the number of moves and the path taken.
